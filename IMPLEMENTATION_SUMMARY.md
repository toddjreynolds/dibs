### Core Features
1. **7-Day Expiration Timer** - Items automatically expire 7 days after upload at 7pm
2. **Point-Based Bidding** - 100-point system for resolving conflicts
3. **Couples Feature** - Two users can be linked to share points and never conflict
4. **Automatic Resolution** - Items resolve based on user actions and expiration
5. **Real-Time Updates** - Points, bids, and resolutions update instantly

### New Components

- `BiddingPanel.jsx` - Three-state bidding interface (Initial → Edit → Completed)

### New Utilities
- `timerUtils.js` - Timer calculations and formatting
- `coupleUtils.js` - Couple relationship management
- `itemResolution.js` - Automatic item resolution logic

### New Hook
- `useExpirationChecker.js` - Background checker for expired items

### Database Changes
- Added 7 new columns across 3 tables
- Created 3 new indexes for performance
- Migration file ready for deployment

### Updated Files
- `ItemCard.jsx` - Integrated all new features
- `Browse.jsx` - Filtering, profiles, points
- `Layout.jsx` - Points display in navigation
- `Upload.jsx` - Set expiration on new items
- `MyChoices.jsx` - Support for new ItemCard props
- `index.css` - Styles for all new components

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
migration-timer-bidding-system.sql
```

### 2. Deploy Code
```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add timer and bidding system"

# Deploy to your hosting platform
# (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Check that timer badges appear on items
- Verify points show in navigation (100 for new users)
- Test creating a conflict and placing bids
- Confirm real-time updates work

## 🎨 Design Implementation

All designs from the mockups have been implemented:

✅ **Timer Badge** - White pill, top-right corner, 8px spacing
✅ **Interested Users** - White pills with heart icons, top-left, stacked
✅ **Bidding Panel State 1** - "Place Your Bid" with available points
✅ **Bidding Panel State 2** - Number input with Cancel/Save buttons
✅ **Bidding Panel State 3** - Bid amount displayed with Edit button
✅ **Pink Overlay** - Gradient background for conflict states
✅ **Price Tag Icon** - Centered badge above bidding panel
✅ **Points Display** - Tag icon with points in navigation bar

## 🔧 Configuration

### Optional: Set Up Couples

To link two users as a couple:

```sql
-- Generate a shared couple_id for two users
UPDATE profiles 
SET couple_id = gen_random_uuid()
WHERE id IN ('user-1-id', 'user-2-id');
```

### Optional: Adjust User Points

```sql
-- Give user more points
UPDATE profiles SET points = 150 WHERE id = 'user-id';

-- Reset all users to 100 points
UPDATE profiles SET points = 100;
```

### Optional: Manually Resolve Item

```sql
-- Mark item as resolved with winner
UPDATE items 
SET status = 'resolved', 
    winner_id = 'user-id',
    resolved_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'item-id';

-- Mark item as donated
UPDATE items 
SET status = 'donated',
    resolved_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 'item-id';
```

## 📊 Testing Status

✅ No linting errors
✅ All components render without errors
✅ TypeScript definitions not needed (using .jsx)
✅ Real-time subscriptions configured
✅ Database schema validated
✅ Migration tested

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Client-Side Expiration Checker
The current implementation checks for expired items in the browser every minute. This works well for active users but has limitations:

- Items only expire when someone is viewing the app
- No background processing when all users are offline

**Recommendation**: Implement server-side cron job for production (see TIMER_AND_BIDDING_IMPLEMENTATION.md for details)

### Couples Management
Currently, couples must be created via SQL. Consider adding:
- Admin UI to create/manage couples
- User profile page to view/request couple status
- Automatic couple detection based on shared address/family

### Points Economy
Starting points: 100 per user
- No point regeneration (one-time allocation)
- No point trading between users
- Winners pay their bid amount

**Future**: Consider periodic point bonuses or earning mechanisms

## 🎯 Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:
- % of conflicts that go to bidding
- Average bid amounts
- Point distribution across users
- Time-to-resolution for conflicts
- User engagement with timer feature

## 🚧 Future Enhancements

Potential next features:
1. **Notifications** - Alert users when they win/lose items
2. **Bid History** - Show past bids on profile
3. **Admin Dashboard** - Manage users, points, couples
4. **Categories** - Filter items by type
5. **Favorites** - Watch items without dibbing
6. **Trading** - Allow point/item exchanges
7. **Analytics** - Dashboard of household statistics

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Deploy to staging first, test thoroughly
2. **User Education**: Explain bidding system to users before launch
3. **Monitor Points**: Check that point economy balances over time
4. **Gather Feedback**: Users may suggest adjustments to 7-day timer
5. **Plan Couples**: Decide how to initially set up couple relationships

## ✨ Final Notes

This implementation provides a robust foundation for the Dibs app's core functionality. The system is designed to be:

- **Scalable** - Efficient queries with proper indexes
- **Real-time** - Instant updates via Supabase subscriptions
- **Flexible** - Easy to adjust rules and time limits
- **Extensible** - Clean architecture for future features

The timer and bidding mechanics create engaging dynamics while the couples feature acknowledges real-world household relationships.

**Ready for deployment! 🎉**
